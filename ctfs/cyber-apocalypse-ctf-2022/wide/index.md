## Challenge

> We've received reports that Draeger has stashed a huge arsenal in the pocket dimension Flaggle Alpha. You've managed to smuggle a discarded access terminal to the Widely Inflated Dimension Editor from his headquarters, but the entry for the dimension has been encrypted. Can you make it inside and take control?


## TL;DR
Open the binary in Ghidra, and find the super secret decryption key for option 6 in the menu function.
